# Spam-Email-Detection
🚀 Project Showcase: Spam Email Detection Using Machine Learning 📧

I'm excited to share my latest project, developed during my internship at @CodexCue. This project involved creating a machine learning model to accurately detect spam emails, providing hands-on experience with real-world data and advanced classification techniques.

🔍 Project Overview:

Data Preprocessing: Handled missing values, encoded categorical variables, and scaled numerical features.
Model Selection: Tested Logistic Regression, Decision Trees, and SVM to find the best model.
Evaluation: Used metrics like accuracy, precision, recall, and F1-score to evaluate model performance.
Outcome: Successfully identified the most effective model, achieving high accuracy in spam detection.
🛠 Tools & Technologies: Python, Pandas, Scikit-learn

A huge thank you to CODEXCUE for giving me the opportunity to work on this exciting project and for their support throughout the internship!
